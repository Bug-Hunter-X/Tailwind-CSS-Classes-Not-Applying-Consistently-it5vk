After thorough investigation, I discovered that a custom CSS stylesheet had rules with higher specificity than Tailwind's. The custom styles were overriding Tailwind classes unexpectedly.  The solution was to either adjust the specificity of the custom styles using the `!important` flag (use cautiously), or refactor the custom CSS to avoid conflicts.  Additionally, I carefully double-checked my class names for typos or other inconsistencies.
